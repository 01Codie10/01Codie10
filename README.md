I joined the Data Science program at Codeup because, as a US NAVY veteran, it was a chance to enter an exciting new field that coincides with my degree plan. So far, I have had a lot of fun dipping my toes in the ocean that is the tech/programming world. The water has been fine, so I can't wait to get the rest of my foot in the door!
